# Education Health Gradient: 
\begin{equation}
health = \alpha + \beta education + \epsilon 
\end{equation}

- if $\beta>0$ does this mean there is a causal relationship
- no

\begin{equation}
health = \alpha + \beta education + \kappa income + \sigma riskpref + \epsilon 
\end{equation}

- Does education have a causal relationship on health and how do we find out?
