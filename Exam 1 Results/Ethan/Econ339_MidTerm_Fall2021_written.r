#Section 2: Lectures
#1
#A) No because it impossible to tell if insurance is being impacted by unaccounted for variables. 
# This means that you cannot prove causation.
#B) It suggests a causal effect but is impossible to prove because of so many variables that could be 
# impacting both doctor visits and insurance. No causal effect.
#C) No, we cannot say that the demand is downward sloping because there is no proof that the price is 
#the driving factor in these individuals visiting the doctor.
#2
#A) This would suggest that insurance is the factor impacting the doctor visits. Showing that having
#insurance increases the probability of going to the doctor.
#B) Yes, all other variables are accounted for by the process of randomization. This means that the 
#insurance is the only variable impacting the rise in doctor visits.
#C) Yes because a positive coefficient means that the two variables are positively correlated. 
#As such, having insurance increases the amount of doctor visits of the individuals in the survey. 

VS comments: there is a different between a randomized setup and analysis that uses survey data.
confounding variables are difficult to account for in a survey setting; hence, the need for randomized study.

#D) The Oregon Health Study is an experiment that saw a lottery select around thirty thousand people to 
#be added to the Medicaid program but only around ten thousand are accepted into the program. 
#This means there is a group of insured and uninsured individuals that were all randomly selected and accounts for 
#all variables outside of insurance by means of the Medicaid program. Form here they found that those who were eligible 
#and accepted into the Medicaid program were visiting the doctor more.

#Section 3: Readings
#1 
#A) The eligibility of Medicare is used as a natural experiment because the only requirement is turning 65 years old. 
## VS: talk about RD approach here

#Nothing else changes discontinuously during this time like the probability of being insured does.
#B) The doctor visits are higher on weekdays than they are on weekends would indicate that people are not waiting to be 
#eligible for Medicare and are instead seeing a doctor as soon as they realize something is wrong. 
#This would eliminate the argument that people are waiting and causing a difference in health stock between those just below and above 65 years old.

## VS: not true. They look for cases that have uniform admission rate in week days as well as weekends. They refer to these cases 
## as non-deferrable conditions. The assumption is that this group would go to see the doctor before and after 65 with the 
## same probability. This mitigates the selection concerns.

#C) Figure IV on page 24 shows the discontinuous break of insured people at the age of 65. 
#This shows how insurance probability increases as you turn 65 and suggests that all other variables are accounted for. 
#As the drastic change of receiving insurance looks to be the factor most important towards decrease in mortality that they found 
## in individuals after turning 65.

## Think about the channel that they argue which is driving a reduction in mortality through Medicare.

#D) The biggest drawback is the human nature. This is to say it is impossible to account for those people who might wait until 
#65 when they receive Medicare before addressing an illness or injury. 
## This could cause people just over the age of 65 to have worse health due to waiting. 
## Overall, it is awfully hard to account for the difference in health stock between individuals just under 65 and just over 65. 
## Also, this study is used for specific types of sever illnesses and so the results cannot be universally applied as many 
## non-life-threatening illnesses are more prone to the waiting game. ## VS: Sounds good. think of external validity as well.
